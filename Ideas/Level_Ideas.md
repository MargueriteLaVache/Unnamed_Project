## General ideas:
	- I think we need 10 levels:
		- One test level with just dummies. or maybe the testing should done at the end of each level? Nah. maybe a few
			easy enemies at the beginning to warm up.
		- 8 weapon levels, one for each weapon appart from the first melee one. Each on serves as a tutorial for the
			weapon. The 7 last levels are locked until the first one is complete (the first one is a genral purpose
			tutorial). Each level ends on a boss fight. Killing the boss ends the level and unlocks the weapon.
		- One final level with a big boss at the end, unlocked only when all the other levels (except the test
			one of course) are complete.
