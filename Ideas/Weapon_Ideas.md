## Random ideas:
	- From Julien: Smoke at the tip of the firearms on fire.
	- The player never needs to reload, because it is badass, I guess.
	- Make every weapon automatic (fire continuously when button pressed)?
	- Melee weapon is unlocked from the beginning, others have to be unlocked through a specific level.

## Retained weapon list and order:
	- Melee weapon (unlocked from the beginning).
	- Desert Eagle (tutorial level?).
	- Shotgun.
	- Rocket launcher.
	- Fire spitter
	- Machine gun.
	- Grenade launcher.
	- Flame thrower.
	- Railgun.
