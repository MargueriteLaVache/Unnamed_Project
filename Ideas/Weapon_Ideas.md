## Weapon idea list:
	- Melee weapon:
		- An AoE centered on the player. Same damage everywhere.
		- Probably an axe.
		- Code done, needs sprite and animations.
	- Desert Eagle:
		- Single shot, semi-automatic weapon.
		- Deals moderate damage, has a moderate rate of fire, projectile is rather fast.
		- Not an AoE.
		- Unlimited range, projectile doesn't falls.
		- Code done, weapon sprite done, needs animations and bullet sprite.
	- Machine gun:
		- Single shot, automatic weapon.
		- Low damage, high RoF, fast projectile.
		- Not AoE.
		- Unlimited range, projectile doesn't falls.
		- Code done, needs sprites and animations.
	- Grenade launcher:
		- Single shot, semi-automatic weapon.
		- Moderate damage, moderate RoF, slow projectile

		- Limited range, projectile falls.
		- Nothing done.
	- Rocket launcher:
		- Single shot, semi-automatic weapon.
		- High damage, slow RoF, moderate projectile speed.
		- AoE. Damage depends on distance to impact.
		- Unlimited range, projectile doesn't falls.

	- Shotgun:
		- Fires a volley of leads (?) in a cone.
		- Multiple shots, semi-automatic weapon.
		- High damage, moderate RoF, very fast projectile speed (not visible?).
		- "AoE". Damage depends on distance to player (Ray-casting).
		- Limited range, projectile doesn't falls.
		- Nothing done but basis of ray-casting.
	- Fire spitter:
		- Continuously damages (flames) in front of the player.
	- Railgun:

## Radom ideas:
	- From Julien: Smoke at the tip on fire of the firearms.
	- The player never needs to reload, because it is badass, I guess.
	- Make every weapon automatic (fire continuously when button pressed)?
