## Weapon idea list:
	- Melee weapon:
		- An AoE centered on the player. Same damage everywhere.
		- Probably an axe.
		- Very high damage, rather high RoF.
		- Code done, needs sprite and animations.
	- Desert Eagle:
		- Single shot, semi-automatic weapon.
		- Deals moderate damage, has a moderate rate of fire, projectile is rather fast.
		- Not an AoE.
		- Unlimited range, projectile doesn't falls.
		- Code done, weapon sprite done, needs animations and bullet sprite.
	- Machine gun:
		- Single shot, automatic weapon.
		- Low damage, high RoF, fast projectile.
		- Not AoE.
		- Unlimited range, projectile doesn't falls.
		- Code done, needs sprites and animations.
	- Grenade launcher:
		- Single shot, semi-automatic weapon.
		- Moderate damage, moderate RoF, slow projectile
		- AoE. Same damage everywhere ?
		- Limited range, projectile falls.
		- Nothing done.
	- Rocket launcher:
		- Single shot, semi-automatic weapon.
		- High damage, slow RoF, moderate projectile speed.
		- AoE. Damage depends on distance to impact.
		- Unlimited range, projectile doesn't falls.
		- Code done, needs sprites and animations.
	- Flame thrower:
		- Throws flaming projectiles that set targets on fire.
		- Multiple shots, automatic weapon.
		- Moderate damage over time, rather fast RoF
		- Not AoE.
		- Limited range, projectile falls (?).
		- Nothing done.
	- Shotgun:
		- Fires a volley of leads (?) in a cone.
		- Multiple shots, semi-automatic weapon.
		- High damage, moderate RoF, very fast projectile speed (not visible?).
		- "AoE". Damage depends on distance to player (Ray-casting).
		- Limited range, projectile doesn't falls. Maybe the range could be unlimited, as I am using the multiple
			projectiles technique.
		- Nothing done but basis of ray-casting.
	- Fire spitter:
		- Continuously damages (flames) in front of the player. Sets on fire.
		- High damage, 
	- Railgun:
		- Shoots a piercing projectile through the map and enemies.
	- Sniper-rifle:
		- Deals critical damage when hitting head/when lucky (?).
		- Maybe redundant with railgun.
	- Boomerang Blades of smth:
		- Blades that are thrown, fly, damage through, and then come back, still damaging. Could be the melee weapon
			that is thrown and comes back.
	- Sound Blaster or Wind Blower or smth:
		- A weapon that pushes back the enemies. Maybe that should be knockback on other weapons, Idk.
		- If sound, could be like music or smth, like death metal or Idk.

## Random ideas:
	- From Julien: Smoke at the tip of the firearms on fire + fire + recoil.
	- The player never needs to reload, because it is badass, I guess.
	- Make every weapon automatic (fire continuously when button pressed)?
	- Melee weapon is unlocked from the beginning, others have to be unlocked through a specific level.
		Maybe they could be unlocked at the beginning of the level, the level serving as a tutorial. Idk.

## Retained weapon list and order:
	- Melee weapon (unlocked from the beginning).
	- Desert Eagle (tutorial level?).
	- Shotgun.
	- Rocket launcher.
	- Fire spitter
	- Machine gun.
	- Grenade launcher.
	- Flame thrower.
	- Railgun.
