# General ideas:
	The game could be about a recurring character that we follow through various adventures in different games,
	kind of like creating a franchise. I don't think this character can be Gogol, as he is kind of limited,
	but maybe they could be related? I'm thinking maybe they are linked somehow, and they live various
	adventures separated or together.
	I think that for this game, the story should be short, as it is an action game, not a place where people
	actually want to read. Also, I think it is too early for Witness Me Studio to deal with complex stories.
