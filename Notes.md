- I think it is better to stick with 1920*1080 with a stretch scale of 1 for the viewport,
	because the other options (making it small and scaling, or stretching) are not satisfying.
	This makes everything very zoomed out but it is ok.

- 2023/12/06 : The animations are set up, but there is a lot of dupplication in the code. It's not a big deal.

- 2023/12/08 : I created a new level of State scripts so that the jump variables aren't shared by all States.
	Can Move is useless for now.
