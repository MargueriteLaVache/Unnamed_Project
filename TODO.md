NOT DONE :

- Comment the code.
- Finish the code in hit_state.
- Finish the code for test_moving_enemy, should be a state machine and all the tintouin.
- To do when the options are set up: try to move the self_damage assign in bullet_3.gd to _ready() instead
	(Use a global signal? That would be swag for sure.) (idk what this means, maybe it is done).
- Handle the part where the characters fall when they die (animation).
- Handle the part where the characters fall when they die (sound).
- Add easter eggs, such as a button that screams.
- Add funny descriptions to the weapons.
- Solve window size issue.
- Fix the variables of player.gd and movement_state.gd (find them a place).
- Solve possible issue: jump animation playing when falling (at beginning).
- Fix the rolling (landing) animation when going backwards.
- Fix the melee weapon AoE bug (cf 2024/07/06)?
- Unit tests? Asserts.
- Make enemies stop between two wanderings.
- Implement blast of the explosion of rockets and so on, like move the characters when hit.
- Make a story.
- Make it so that the player can't shoot after death. Or just handle after-death.
- Put self_damage in options.
- Blink?
- Balancing.
- Piercing shot (I think I'd need to move the queue_free in bullet.gd to the subclasses or smth).
- Add inverted gravity mechanic.
- Add water mechanic.
- Achievements.
- Death animations.
- Complete the code for the health change label (make it use the radius of the circle and so on) when new enemy shapes
	are added.
- Decide what weapons there will be.
- Have "allumer le feu" when setting something on fire as an option. Hard because of copyright.
- Add powers, such as crits or smth.
- Add indicator of reload time left. Make reload bar.
- Bosses (levels).
- Navigate through weapons via # keys.
- User key mapping?
- Bug: sometimes, the fire spitter weapon does not deal any damage (it probably deals 0, as it calls take_damage() on
	target).
- Fix hit state for tme.
- Make some kind of rampaging or score or whatever.
- Make health bar.
- Find a way to have global variables.
