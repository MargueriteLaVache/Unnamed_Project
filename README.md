A cubic character named X, harrassed by monsters/spheres for his difformity,
decides to take revenge on the world and to make them all pay.
To do so, X will have to navigate levels and platforms, fighting off hordes
of enemies with a vast array of different guns and other weapons to use.
Those weapons can be unlocked (or bought idk yet) throughout the levels,
and are supplemented by abilities, allowing X to fend off their foes.
